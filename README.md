# Layer Chicken Project Website

## Purpose  
This multipage website was created as part of my web development course final project.  
It serves two purposes:  
1. **Academic** – to demonstrate HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
2. **Practical** – to showcase my real-life layer chicken farming project, where I produce eggs and promote sustainable poultry farming.  


##  Website Structure  
The site consists of **5 pages**:  
- **Home (index.html):** Introductory page with a hero section and navigation.  
- **About (about.html):** Background of the project with images of chickens and eggs.  
- **Services (services.html):** Information on the farm’s offerings (egg sales, poultry training).  
- **Gallery (gallery.html):** A collection of photos from the farm, displayed in a responsive grid.  
- **Contact (contact.html):** Contact form and details for reaching out.  

## Design Choices  
- **Colors:** Green (#4CAF50) for farming/nature, Yellow (#FFC107) for eggs, Brown (#8D6E63) for earth tones, Cream (#FFFBE6) for background.  
- **Images:** Realistic photos of chickens, eggs, and the farm to create authenticity.  
- **Layout:** Responsive design using CSS grid and flexbox.  
- **Consistency:** Shared header and footer across all pages.  

## ⚡ Interactive Features  
- Responsive **navigation bar** across pages.  
- **Image gallery with popup viewer** (click to enlarge).  
- **Hover animations** on buttons and images.
